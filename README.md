# SU_DCDC_Module2
Based on observations done in central Stockholm, Sweden, a problem found was that dangerous
situations occurred and disturbed the traffic flow as pedestrians rushed and jaywalked to catch a bus.
The aim of this project is to create a digital twin of a dynamic city traffic system in order to aid in
reducing jaywalking caused by rushing to public transport. The design concept developed uses
Bluetooth proximity sensing buses nearby a pedestrian. Through an application, the user can select the
bus they want to catch. Thereafter, a signal is sent to the bus driver to wait. Simultaneously, the phone
sends a signal to the traffic light system to request for a dynamic change in its scheduling, which
grants the pedestrian priority for crossing.
The digital twin was developed in Unity, using NavMesh as the data structure to utilize pathfinding to
simulate the dynamic traffic flow.
